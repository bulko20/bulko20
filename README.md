### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- I am still learning how to use GitHub.
- I'm currently taking a bachelor's degree in Meteorology.
- My undergraduate thesis is about the climate zones of a certain area determined using ERA5 data.
- My coding skills are fair at best and may be limited to unsupervised machine learning particularly in applying K-means clustering.
- I also play games.
