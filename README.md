### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am still learning how to use GitHub.
- I'm currently taking a bachelor's degree in Meteorology.
- My research is about a climate study of a certain area using ERA5 data.
- I suck at coding (which sucks because my program is lowkey "data science") and I need MAJOR HELP in that field.
- I also play games.
