### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm pat, a student meteorologist based in the Philippines that aims to specialize in climatology and climate change.
- My undergraduate thesis is about the climate zones of a certain area determined using ERA5 data.
- My coding skills are fair at best and may be limited to unsupervised machine learning particularly in applying K-means clustering.
- Aside from meteorology, I'm also an avid game lover (Balatro enjoyer as of the moment).

I'm open to joining free courses on machine learning, especially on TensorFlow and scikit, and applying them to automating meteorological related analysis.
If you have any knowledge on these courses, please reach out to me at 21-1-01096@vsu.edu.ph.
